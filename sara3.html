            <h2>2.a. Definitions and Concepts</h2>
            <p>
                Efficient drainage systems are crucial for managing water-related disasters in urban areas. The design and maintenance of these systems can be optimized using advanced algorithms to minimize flooding risks, ensure quick water flow, and reduce economic losses. Below are the algorithmic applications that can be used for achieving this goal:
