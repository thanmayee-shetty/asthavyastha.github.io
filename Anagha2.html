    <h2>Data Structures and Algorithms for Sustainable Infrastructure Development</h2>

    <h2>Graphs (DFS BFS)</h2>
    <p>    * Step 1: Represent the infrastructure network as a graph, where nodes are components (roads, bridges, power plants) and edges represent connections.</p>
    <p>    * Step 2: Analyze network connectivity, identify critical paths, and optimize resource allocation using graph algorithms like  BFS, or DFS.</p>

    <h2>Trees (e.g., AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree)</h2>
    <p>    * Step 1: Organize hierarchical data like project dependencies, resource allocation, or environmental impact assessments in a balanced tree structure. </p>
    <p>    * Step 2: Efficiently search, insert, and delete information within the tree, ensuring project timelines are met and resources are managed effectively while maintaining balanced tree properties for optimal performance.</p>

    <h2>Heaps (e.g., Min-Heap)</h2>
    <p>    * Step 1: Prioritize tasks or resource allocation based on urgency or cost using a min-heap.</p>
    <p>    * Step 2: Efficiently extract the task or resource with the highest priority, ensuring timely completion and optimal resource utilization.</p>

    <h2>Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort)</h2>
    <p>    * Step 1: Sort data related to infrastructure projects, resource allocation, or environmental impact assessments based on various criteria (e.g., cost, timeline, environmental impact).</p>
    <p>    * Step 2: Identify trends, optimize resource allocation, and make informed decisions based on the sorted data.</p>

    <h2>Single-Source Shortest Paths</h2>
    <p>    * Algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm</p>
    <p>    * Application: </p>
    <p>        * Step 1: Represent the infrastructure network as a weighted graph, where edges are assigned weights representing factors like distance, cost, or travel time.</p>
    <p>        * Step 2: Use Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest paths from a single source node (e.g., a central hub) to all other nodes in the network. The Bellman-Ford algorithm can be used in cases where edge weights may be negative.</p>

    <h2>All-Pairs Shortest Paths</h2>
    <p>    * Algorithm: Floyd-Warshall Algorithm</p>
    <p>    * Application: </p>
    <p>        * Step 1: Represent the infrastructure network as a weighted graph.</p>
    <p>        * Step 2: Use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in the network. This information can be valuable for optimizing transportation routes, identifying bottlenecks, and improving overall network efficiency.</p>
    
    <h2>Minimum Spanning Tree</h2>
    <p>    * Algorithms: Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm</p>
    <p>    * Application: </p>
    <p>        * Step 1: Represent the infrastructure network as a weighted graph.</p>
    <p>        * Step 2: Use Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of the network, which can help in designing cost-effective and efficient infrastructure layouts (e.g., connecting power grids, laying pipelines).</p>
