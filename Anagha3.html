<h2>1. Rabin-Karp Algorithm</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Initially, we can strat by  Calculating hash values for the pattern (e.g., keywords like "historical sites" or "budget hotels") and substrings within tourist reviews or descriptions.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Compare hash values and perform character-by-character verification to quickly identify reviews or descriptions that contain the desired keywords, helping tourists find relevant information efficiently.</li>

</ul>

<h2>2.Brute Force String Matching</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: Compare each character of the search term (e.g., a specific restaurant name) with each character in the tourist review text.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Continue checking for a match until the end of the text or a match is found. This can be used to find specific attractions or services mentioned in reviews.</li>

</ul>

<h2>3. Dijkstra's Algorithm</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: Represent the city's transportation network (roads, public transport) as a graph, with nodes representing attractions and edges representing connections.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Utilize Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest paths between different tourist attractions, helping visitors plan efficient travel routes and optimize their time.</li>

<h2>4. Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-first Search</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: Represent the city's attractions and their connections as a graph.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Explore the graph level by level, finding all attractions within a certain distance or number of stops from a starting point, allowing tourists to discover nearby attractions easily.

    </li>
</ul>



<h2>5. Merge Sort</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: Divide the list of tourist attractions (e.g., by rating, price, or popularity) into smaller sub-lists.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Recursively sort each sub-list and then merge them back together to create a sorted list, allowing tourists to easily find the best options that match their preferences.</li>

<h2>6. Arrays</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: Store information about tourist attractions (name, location, description, opening hours, etc.) in an array.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Access and retrieve information about specific attractions efficiently using array indices, enabling quick lookups and easy data management for tourism businesses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Trie</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: Create a Trie data structure to store and efficiently search for words or phrases related to tourist interests (e.g., "historical sites," "art museums," "budget hotels").</li>
    <li>Step 2: Use the Trie to quickly search for and suggest relevant attractions based on user input or search queries, providing personalized recommendations.</li>
