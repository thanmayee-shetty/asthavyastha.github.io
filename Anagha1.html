    <h2>1. Dijkstra's Algorithm</h2>
<p>Step 1: Create a graph representing the road network, with nodes as locations and edges as roads.</p>
<p>Step 2: Use a priority queue to efficiently find the shortest paths from a source node (emergency response center) to all other nodes.</p>


<h2>2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h2>
<p>Step 1: Create a graph as in Dijkstra's algorithm.</p>
<p>Step 2: Explore the graph level by level, finding the shortest paths in terms of the number of hops, which can be useful for finding the closest available emergency unit.</p>

<h2>3. Depth-First Search (DFS)</h2>
<p>Step 1: Create a graph as in Dijkstra's algorithm.</p>
<p>Step 2: Explore the graph by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking, which can be useful for finding alternative routes or exploring less-traveled areas.</p>

<h2>4. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithms (Kruskal's or Prim's)</h2>
<p>Step 1: Create a graph as in Dijkstra's algorithm.</p>
<p>Step 2: Find the minimum spanning tree of the graph, which can be used to optimize the placement of emergency response units or to identify critical road segments for maintenance.</p>

<h2>5. Union-Find Algorithm</h2>
<p>Step 1: Create a disjoint-set data structure to represent connected components in the road network.</p>
<p>Step 2: Use the union-find algorithm to efficiently determine if two locations are connected, which can be useful for identifying isolated areas or planning evacuation routes.</p>

<h2>6. Hash Tables</h2>
<p>Step 1: Create a hash table to store and quickly retrieve information about emergency units, such as their location, availability, and equipment.</p>
<p>Step 2: Use the hash table to efficiently dispatch the most appropriate unit for a given emergency.</p>
