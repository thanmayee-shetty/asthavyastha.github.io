            <li>SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Business Case:</strong> Healthcare development focuses on improving hospitals, clinics, and emergency services to make healthcare accessible to more people. It ensures that healthcare facilities are modernized and reach underserved communities, helping them get better medical attention when needed.</p>
        
        <p class="plan"><strong>Plan for Implementation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dijkstra’s Algorithm:</strong> Used to find the fastest route for ambulances to reach emergency locations.</li>
            <li><strong>Heap Sort:</strong> Helps prioritize the construction of hospitals in areas with high demand based on population and current healthcare services.</li>
                <li><strong>How?</strong></li>
                <li>Step 1: Collect data on population density and existing healthcare facilities.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Use the data to optimize ambulance routes and allocate resources effectively.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Sustainable Infrastructure Development -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Sustainable Infrastructure Development (Green Buildings and Transport)</h2>
        <p class="sdgs">SDGs Mapped:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)</li>

            <li>SDG 13 (Climate Action)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Business Case:</strong> Sustainable infrastructure focuses on creating energy-efficient buildings and greener transportation systems. This helps reduce carbon emissions and supports a cleaner, more livable environment. By incorporating renewable energy sources and smart transport solutions, we can make cities more sustainable and reduce pollution.</p>
        
        <p class="plan"><strong>Plan for Implementation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>QuickSort:</strong> Used to organize building materials based on cost, energy efficiency, and environmental impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Kruskal’s Algorithm:</strong> Helps design the most efficient public transport routes to minimize emissions and optimize resources.</li>
                <li><strong>How?</strong></li>
            <li>Step 1: Collect data on traffic patterns and energy usage for buildings.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Use algorithms to prioritize areas for new green buildings and optimize transport routes.</li>
        </ul>
