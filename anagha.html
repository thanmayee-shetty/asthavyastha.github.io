    <!-- Healthcare Development -->
    <section>
        <h2>1. Healthcare Development</h2>
        <p><strong>SDGs Mapped:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being)</b></li>
            <li><b>SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality)</b></li>
            <li><b>SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Business Case:</strong> Healthcare development focuses on improving hospitals, clinics, and emergency services to make healthcare accessible to more people. It ensures that healthcare facilities are modernized and reach underserved communities, helping them get better medical attention when needed.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Plan for Implementation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dijkstra’s Algorithm:</strong> Used to find the fastest route for ambulances to reach emergency locations.</li>
            <li><strong>Heap Sort:</strong> Helps prioritize the construction of hospitals in areas with high demand based on population and current healthcare services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How?</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Collect data on population density and existing healthcare facilities.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Use the data to optimize ambulance routes and allocate resources effectively.</li>
        </ol>

    <!-- Sustainable Infrastructure Development -->
    <section>
        <h2>2. Sustainable Infrastructure Development (Green Buildings and Transport)</h2>
        <p><strong>SDGs Mapped:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)</b></li>
            <li><b>SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure)</b></li>
            <li><b>SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)</b></li>
            <li><b>SDG 13 (Climate Action)</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Business Case:</strong> Sustainable infrastructure focuses on creating energy-efficient buildings and greener transportation systems. This helps reduce carbon emissions and supports a cleaner, more livable environment. By incorporating renewable energy sources and smart transport solutions, we can make cities more sustainable and reduce pollution.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Plan for Implementation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>QuickSort:</strong> Used to organize building materials based on cost, energy efficiency, and environmental impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Kruskal’s Algorithm:</strong> Helps design the most efficient public transport routes to minimize emissions and optimize resources.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How?</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Collect data on traffic patterns and energy usage for buildings.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Use algorithms to prioritize areas for new green buildings and optimize transport routes.</li>
        </ol>

    <!-- Electricity Distribution -->
    <section>
        <h2>3. Electricity Distribution</h2>
        <p><strong>SDGs Mapped:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)</li>
            <li>SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure)</li>
            <li>SDG 13 (Climate Action)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Business Case:</strong> Optimizing electricity distribution ensures that energy reaches everyone efficiently, with minimal losses. By integrating renewable energy sources like wind and solar, we can make electricity distribution more sustainable and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Plan for Implementation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bellman-Ford Algorithm:</strong> Used to find the most cost-effective way to lay out power lines from power plants to homes and businesses.</li>
            <li><strong>Kruskal’s Algorithm:</strong> Helps build a minimal spanning tree for the power grid, ensuring it is cost-effective while connecting all necessary points.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How?</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Identify the locations of power plants and areas with high energy demand.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Use algorithms to optimize the power distribution network and reduce losses.</li>
