        <h2>1. Food for Homeless and Nutrition</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>0. Indicator Information (SDG_INDICATOR_INFO)</strong><br>
            <strong>0.a. Goal (SDG_GOAL):</strong> Goal 2: To end hunger, achieve food security for homeless, and promote sustainable agriculture.<br>
            <strong>0.b. Target (SDG_TARGET):</strong> Target 2.1: By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food all year round.<br>
            <strong>0.c. Indicator (SDG_INDICATOR):</strong> Indicator 2.1.1: Prevalence of undernourishment.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>2.a. Definitions and Concepts:</strong><br>
            Access to nutritious food for homeless populations is critical for achieving food security. This involves creating efficient food distribution networks to ensure surplus food from various sources (restaurants, grocery stores, and farms) reaches shelters and food banks. Algorithms can help optimize this distribution to reduce waste and ensure timely delivery.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Algorithmic Applications:</strong><br>
            1. Route for food distribution: Dijkstra’s algorithm can calculate the shortest and fastest routes to distribute food to homeless shelters or areas of need.<br>
            2. Cost analysis of Food Allocation: Kruskal’s algorithm can help in designing networks to minimize transportation costs.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Drainage Systems</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>0. Indicator Information (SDG_INDICATOR_INFO)</strong><br>
            <strong>0.a. Goal (SDG_GOAL):</strong> Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.<br>
            <strong>0.b. Target (SDG_TARGET):</strong> Target 6.3: By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping, and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and materials.<br>
            <strong>0.c. Indicator (SDG_INDICATOR):</strong> Indicator 6.3.2: Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>2.a. Definitions and Concepts:</strong><br>
            Efficient drainage systems are critical for urban infrastructure to manage stormwater, prevent flooding, and maintain public hygiene. Planning these systems requires optimization of water flow, placement of drainage points, and ensuring connectivity between them.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Algorithmic Applications:</strong><br>
            1. Shortest Path for Drainage Design: Dijkstra’s could be used to design efficient connections between drainage points to minimize water stagnation.<br>
            2. Minimum Spanning Tree: Using Kruskal’s or Prim’s algorithm, optimal placement and connection of drainage infrastructure can be planned to cover maximum areas with minimum cost.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Natural Disaster Management</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>0. Indicator Information (SDG_INDICATOR_INFO)</strong><br>
            <strong>0.a. Goal (SDG_GOAL):</strong> Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.<br>
            <strong>0.b. Target (SDG_TARGET):</strong> Target 13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.<br>
            <strong>0.c. Indicator (SDG_INDICATOR):</strong> Indicator 13.1.2: Number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>2.a. Definitions and Concepts:</strong><br>
            Natural disaster management involves preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery. Efficient evacuation plans, resource allocation, and damage minimization are crucial to saving lives and reducing economic loss.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Algorithmic Applications:</strong><br>
            1. Evacuation Planning: Breadth-First Search (BFS) can be used to identify the safest and quickest evacuation routes during disasters.<br>
            2. Resource Distribution: Using Dijkstra’s or Prim’s algorithms for emergency resources such as food, water, and medical supplies can be routed to affected areas efficiently.<br>
            3. Flood Prediction: Warshall’s algorithm can be applied to analyze and predict the impact of rising water levels and to identify weak points in the drainage.<br>
            4. Damage Assessment: Kruskal’s algorithm could assist in mapping the most efficient network for inspection and repair teams to cover affected areas post-disaster.
