        <h2>About Our Project</h2>
        <p>We were given the opportunity to design a smart city based off our imagination within 1500 sq m of barren land. Our city is decentralized so that we could provide better facilities and focus on each part of our city while giving every part equal attention.Mapping it out was not an easy task as we faced challenges like how can we make transport efficient, make the city as sustainable as we can, help out all the sectors with their problems and where exactly should we place each part of the population. </p>
