        <h2>About Our Project</h2>
        <p>We were given the opportunity to design a smart city based off our imagination within 1500 sq m of barren land. Our city is decentralized so that we could provide better facilities and focus on each part of our city while giving every part equal attention. Mapping it out was not an easy task as we faced challenges like how we can make transport efficient, make the city as sustainable as we can, help out all the sectors with their problems, and where exactly should we place each part of the population.</p>

        <p>The highlight of our city is decentralization, which divides the given area into four sub-cities,so that each of the city can have a self sustained system, not having to depend on the centre for resources and management .
        </p>
        <p>The development of the city will take place in Phases where in each phase the focus will be on a particular area or a social/economic aspect . The key approach here was the development of one of the sub cities at once </p>
        <p>Rather than scattering the development through the whole city , Only one of the sub cities(covering atmost 1/4th area )will be built .After the development of the first city , its working,progress rate, pros and cons would be analyzed, and the data would be used to implement the next city in a much efficient and upgraded way .</p>
