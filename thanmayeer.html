            <h2>Learning Algorithms</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Understanding Thought Processes:</b> This course helped me realize that no matter how much you study, there is always more to learn. The algorithms I learned were simple, but the thought process behind them fascinated me. Understanding why these solutions were chosen, and the reasoning of their creators, was a significant focus for me. 
                <br><br>
                <b>Applications:</b> Real-time applications of these algorithms are numerous. For example, the invitation problem demonstrates the need for finding the shortest route between destinations. Algorithms like Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s, Floyd’s, and Warshall’s provide excellent solutions, though they are limited to possibilities—we still have to choose the best solution ourselves. Sorting algorithms are another example of well-thought-out designs, even if some are inefficient for larger datasets. The innovative thinking behind each algorithm is what I deeply appreciate.
                <br><br>
                There were times in this course when I spent hours on a problem only to arrive at a few lines of code for the solution. This experience taught me to never give up on a challenge. Prakash Sir’s guidance and his balanced teaching approach have been instrumental in helping me improve my problem-solving skills.

            <h2>Why Nature?</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Patterns in Nature:</b> Nature is full of patterns that have inspired countless inventions by our ancestors. Biomimicry, a widely discussed topic today, demonstrates how much we can learn from nature. The portfolio work we did previously included examples of patterns in nature, helping us realize its true wonder and the potential for human innovation.
                <br><br>
                Recursive patterns seen in insects and certain animals, like reptiles, highlight the importance of observing our surroundings. Such observations could lead to eureka moments and groundbreaking ideas.

            <h2>Space and Time Efficiency</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Determinants of Code Quality:</b> Space efficiency refers to the extra space used by a program, where higher usage is undesirable. Time efficiency, on the other hand, is the time required to execute a given size of input. Both metrics are crucial for evaluating whether a program is good enough to be presented as a solution.

            <h2>Data Structures</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Key Data Structures:</b> Trees and graphs stand out for their utility. Trees help reduce execution time, while graphs represent relationships between entities and how they are connected. Graphs, with their use of weights, assist in solving problems like navigation and understanding computer networks.
                <br><br>
                Interestingly, both trees and graphs are implemented using arrays, with the iterator and its value being the key differences. These differences are what enable us to construct and use trees and graphs effectively in systems.
