                <b>0.Indicator information (SDG_INDICATOR_INFO)</b> <br>
                <b>0.a. Goal (SDG_GOAL)</b> <br>
                Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. <br>
                <b>0.b. Target (SDG_TARGET) Target 11.7:</b> By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities. <br>
                <b>0.c. Indicator (SDG_INDICATOR) Indicator 11.7.1:</b> Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities. <br>
                <br>
                <b>2.a. Definitions and concepts</b> <br>
                According to SDG 11.7.1 45% - 50% of the area of a city should be covered with public spaces. The Global Public Space toolkit defines Public Space as all places that are publicly owned or of public use, accessible and enjoyable by all, for free and without a profit motive, categorized into streets, open spaces and public facilities. This definition implies a higher level of community interaction and places a focus on public involvement rather than public ownership or stewardship. For the purpose of monitoring and reporting on indicator 11.7.1, public space is defined as all places of public use, accessible by all, and comprises open public space and streets.
                <br><br>
                Streets are an important factor in public spaces which are most commonly lined with houses or buildings used by pedestrians or vehicles in order to go from one place to another in the city, interact and to earn a livelihood. Their distribution around the city should help connect people and places in an efficient manner while keeping the amount of resources used in mind.
                <br>
                Public spaces are closer to residential areas hence in the 45 sq km area that we have allotted, most of the public spaces will be there(this does not imply that the other regions won't have any). Since the circular borders are not actually huge compounds between the regions i.e all the regions are interconnected through tramps and roads. After the distribution of the places the paths can be thought about through algorithms like Kruskal's(that finds the minimum distance between 2 points). Applying these algorithms will help my team understand where we need to lay the foundation of our paths and tracks.
                <br>
                Here is an example for Kruskal's algorithm I talked about:<a href="https://github.com/thanmayee-shetty/asthavyastha.github.io/blob/main/kruskal.cpp" target="_blank">Kruskal’s Algorithm</a>
                <br>Kruskal’s algorithm uses quick sort, here is a code of quick sort for reference:<a href="https://github.com/thanmayee-shetty/asthavyastha.github.io/blob/main/quicksort.cpp" target="_blank">Quick Sort</a>
